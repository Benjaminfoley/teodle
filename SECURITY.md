# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it using the **private vulnerability reporting** feature at https://github.com/Zaczero/teodle/security/advisories.

[Learn more about private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

I will review your report and take appropriate steps to address the vulnerability. I will also acknowledge your contribution once the issue has been resolved, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please allow me a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publicly disclosing it. I will keep you informed about the progress I make in addressing the vulnerability.

Thank you for your help in keeping this project and community safe.
