Teodle is a Python-powered website for [Twitch streamer Teo](https://www.twitch.tv/teosgame), to watch game clips submitted by his community and guess the ranks.
The livestream viewers can also participate in the game by casting their votes in the Twitch chat.
The most accurate viewers are displayed on the leaderboard.

## Ranking System

The ranking system in Teodle is primarily based on stars, the more stars, the higher the score.

The rules are simple:

* If you guess the exact rank of a game clip, you get 2 stars.
* If you are 1 rank off, you get 1 star.
* Otherwise, you get no stars.

## Live Participation

Viewers can play along during livestreams by voting in the chat and competing for both accuracy and speed. The leaderboard showcases the top performing viewers.
