Teodle is a Python-powered website for [Twitch streamer Teo](https://www.twitch.tv/teosgame) to watch and rank game clips submitted by his viewers.

## Ranking System

The ranking system in Teodle is primarily based on stars, the more stars, the higher the score.

The rules are simple:

* If you guess the exact rank of a game clip, you get 2 stars.
* If you are 1 rank off, you get 1 star.
* Otherwise, you get no stars.

## Live Participation

Viewers can play along during livestreams by voting in the chat and competing for both accuracy and speed. The leaderboard showcases the top performing viewers.
